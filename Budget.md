# Project Budget

## Overview

As of the current stage of our project, we have not incurred any monetary expenses. Our work has primarily involved the use of free software tools and resources that are available at no cost.

### Software and Tools Used

- **Unity Engine**: Free version used for game development and simulation.
- **ML-Agents Toolkit**: An open-source Unity plugin used for machine learning purposes.
- **Various Online Resources**: Free tutorials and guides.

### Future Considerations

While our current progress has not required any financial expenditure, we will continue to assess the need for any potential resources that may involve costs. Should such needs arise, we will document and justify these expenses accordingly.
