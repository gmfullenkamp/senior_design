1. Enhance the Observation Space
Make sure your agent has a comprehensive view of its environment. Consider adding:

Relative Position to Food: If not already included, ensuring the agent knows where the food is relative to its current position can help it make more informed decisions.
Obstacle and Tail Detection: Information about nearby walls, the position of its tail, and potential upcoming obstacles could help the agent avoid collisions.
Directional Sensors: Implement raycasts or sensors that detect the distance to obstacles in multiple directions around the agent. This can help it navigate complex situations.
2. Refine the Reward Function
A well-designed reward function is crucial for effective learning:

Penalize Dangerous Moves: Introduce slight negative rewards for moves that bring the snake closer to walls or its tail, encouraging safer navigation.
Reward Efficient Pathfinding: Beyond just eating food, consider rewarding the agent for reaching food in fewer steps to promote efficiency.
Negative Reward for Time Wasting: To discourage aimless wandering, you could implement a small time penalty for each move that doesn't result in eating food.
3. Complexity Gradation (Curriculum Learning)
Start with simpler environments (e.g., fewer obstacles or a smaller tail) and gradually increase the complexity as the agent learns. This can help the agent master basic strategies before tackling more complex scenarios.
